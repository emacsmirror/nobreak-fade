;;; Commentary:

;; This is some "nobreak" functions for `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
;; See each docstring for details.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and up.  Does nothing in XEmacs 21 as it doesn't
;; have a nobreak.

;;; Install:

;; Put nobreak-fade.el in one of your `load-path' directories and in your
;; .emacs put for instance
;;
;;     (autoload 'nobreak-fade-single-letter-p "nobreak-fade")
;;     (add-hook 'fill-nobreak-predicate 'nobreak-fade-single-letter-p)
;;
;; For Emacs 20 and 21 try `nobreak-fade-add' below which copes with
;; `fill-nobreak-predicate' being a plain variable in those versions,
;;
;;     (require 'nobreak-fade)
;;     (nobreak-fade-add 'nobreak-fade-single-letter-p)
;;
;; There's autoload cookies for the functions if you know how to use
;; `update-file-autoloads' and friends, after which just add-hook or
;; customize.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - custom-option for nobreak-fade-single-letter-p too
;; Version 3 - nobreak-fade prefix for all funcs
;;           - new nobreak-fade-emacs-M-x-p
;; Version 4 - new nobreak-fade-add
;; Version 5 - new nobreak-fade-emacs-info-link-p

;;; Code:

(defvar help-xref-info-regexp) ;; help.el or help-mode.el

;;;###autoload
(defun nobreak-fade-add (pred &optional local)
  "Add PRED to `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
If PRED is already in `fill-nobreak-predicate' then do nothing.
If LOCAL is non-nil then add buffer-local.

This is a handy way to cope with `fill-nobreak-predicate' being a
single function in Emacs 21 and earlier.  For Emacs 22 it's a
hook and this function is simply

    (add-hook 'fill-nobreak-predicate PRED nil LOCAL)

If you always use 22 and up then you may as well write that
directly, or use customize.

In Emacs 21 this function manipulates a single lambda form in
`fill-nobreak-predicate'.  And in XEmacs 21 it does nothing as
there's no such variable.

The new PRED is always prepended to any existing
`fill-nobreak-predicate' checks.  The order checks are made
normally doesn't matter."

(defun nobreak-fade-single-letter-p ()
  "Don't dangle a single letter at start or end of sentence.
This function is designed for use in `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
It prevents a line break after a single-letter word at the start
of a sentence, like

    This is some text.  A     <--- no break after \"A\"
    lot more is possible.

and similarly before a single letter word at the end of a
sentence,

    `Wandering minstrel,
    I'.                       <--- no break before \"I\"

The idea is that it's easier on the eye not to have a small word
dangling at the start or end of a sentence, especially at the
start.

A single punctuation character can be present too, such as a
quotation mark, comma, or bracket.  More than one is not made a
nobreak as the visual effect isn't as bad.

See `fill-single-word-nobreak-p' (new in Emacs 23) for a nobreak
of any first or last word, not just single letter ones."

(defun nobreak-fade-emacs-M-x-p ()
  "Don't break after an Emacs M-x.
This function is designed for use in `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
It keeps an M-x on the same line as the command name that follows.

    M-x some-sort-of-command
       ^
       | no break here

This is meant to be easier on the eye than an M-x dangling at the
end of a line, and can help make it clear the command name is
indeed a command name.

A quoted `M-x' without a command name, or an M-x at the end of
sentence etc is not affected, only if followed by a word or
symbol.

This is Emacs specific but should be rare otherwise and so should
do no harm if enabled globally.  Having it in all modes is good
if writing about Emacs things in `text-mode', `texinfo-mode',
etc."

(defun nobreak-fade-emacs-url-p ()
  "Don't break after URL of \"URL `http://...'\".
This function is designed for use in `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
It avoids a line break after the URL in an Emacs docstring form
like

    URL `http://...'
       ^
       | no break here

This is only for visual effect.  The help system recognises a URL
link like this perfectly well with or without a newline.

This nobreak is specific to Emacs docstrings but a URL and
backquote should be rare in other text and so should do no harm
if enabled globally."

  (and (>= (- (point) 4) (point-min))
       (save-excursion
         (goto-char (- (point) 4))

;;;###autoload
(defun nobreak-fade-emacs-info-link-p ()
  "Don't break within an Emacs docstring info link.
This function is designed for use in `fill-nobreak-predicate'.
It keeps the node name part of an info link on one line,

    See Info node `(elisp)Documentation Tips'
                                       ^
                         no break here |

Prior to Emacs 23.2 if there's a newline within the node name
then pressing Ret to follow it only takes the name up to the
newline.  This is fixed in Emacs 23.2 but avoiding a newline
helps earlier versions.

The \"Info node\" part introducing the link can have newlines,
the problem is only in the node name.

This nobreak is specific to Emacs docstrings but an Info node
form will be rare in other text and so this nobreak should do no
harm if enabled globally."
